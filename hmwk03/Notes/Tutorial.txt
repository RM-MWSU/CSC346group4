StAX is a pull model API -> Handler Class calls parser API
Works close to PrintStream
Generally used as a file parser

Advantages ->
Intuitive to use, works off of events
Stop parsing at any time
Generally does anything that SAX does, so any instance in which that is used, this is better
Major package, still receiving updates
Supports stream and event based reading

Disadvantages ->
Since StAX reads the entire document over, depending on size, this can make the reading process slower

General Info ->
StAX is best used when passing an entire XML document as a variable, makes it easier to handle by streaming
StAX was designed with binding XML data to Java objects in mind
StAX can read and write to XML documents, where SAX can only read
Tokens are passed the same way they appear in a document
These tokens are reported based on their nature
StAX resolves on an event based system, as it encounters it, it reads it

General Use ->
1. Import statements

import javax.xml.namespace.QName;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLEventReader;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;
import javax.xml.stream.events.Attribute;
import javax.xml.stream.events.EndElement;
import javax.xml.stream.events.StartElement;
import javax.xml.stream.events.XMLEvent;

2. Create an XML factory and point it to the XML file
 XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory();

3. (Optional Depending on complexity) True or False statements to mark a tag as used
boolean bStateName = false;
boolean bNickname = false;
boolean bCapital = false;
boolean bPopulation = false;

4. Have an XMLEventReader object ready
XMLEventReader eventReader = factory.createXMLEventReader(new FileReader("states.xml"));

5. Have an XMLEvent variable ready to read the events
XMLEvent event = eventReader.nextEvent;

6. Use either a switch or if else chain to process your data to where you need it

7. Pulling out an element using Characters
