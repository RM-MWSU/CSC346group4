StAX is a pull model API -> Handler Class calls parser API
Generally used as a file parser

Advantages ->
Stop parsing at any time
Generally does anything that SAX does, so any instance in which that is used, this is better
Major package, still receiving updates
Supports stream and event based reading

Disadvantages ->
Since StAX reads the entire document over, depending on size, this can make the reading process slower

General Info ->
StAX reads an entire XML document starting at the top and finishing at the bottom
Tokens are passed the same way they appear in a document
These tokens are reported based on their nature
StAX resolves on an event based system, as it encounters it, it reads it

General Use ->
1. Import statements

import javax.xml.namespace.QName;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLEventReader;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;
import javax.xml.stream.events.Attribute;
import javax.xml.stream.events.EndElement;
import javax.xml.stream.events.StartElement;
import javax.xml.stream.events.XMLEvent;

#. Create an XML factory and point it to the XML file

XMLEventReader eventReader = factory.createXMLEventReader(new FileReader("zz_woz.xml"));

#. Have an XMLEvent variable ready to read the events
XMLEvent event = eventReader.nextEvent;
