StAX is a pull model API -> Handler Class calls parser API
Works close to PrintStream
Generally used as a file parser

Advantages ->
Intuitive to use, works off of events
Stop parsing at any time
Generally does anything that SAX does, so any instance in which that is used, this is better
Major package, still receiving updates
Supports stream and event based reading

Disadvantages ->
Since StAX reads the entire document over, depending on size, this can make the reading process slower

General Info ->
StAX is best used when passing an entire XML document as a variable, makes it easier to handle by streaming
StAX was designed with binding XML data to Java objects in mind
StAX can read and write to XML documents, where SAX can only read
Tokens are passed the same way they appear in a document
These tokens are reported based on their nature
StAX resolves on an event based system, as it encounters it, it reads it
